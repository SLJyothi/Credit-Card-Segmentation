Credit-Card-Segmentation
The competitive in financial industries are getting harder in the next decade. One of this industry main source of revenue are Interest Income which they could get by giving loan or credit payment facilities to customer. Therefore, the more the credit are given, the more interest they get and will cluster the data using unsupervised learning with K-Means

Context
Marketing can help businesses increase brand awareness, engagement and sales with promotional campaigns. No matter what area a business focuses on, they can take advantage of all the benefits marketing can offer and expand their reach.

One of method for the marketing team to understand their customer, is by dividing their customer by their characteristic which is called customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics â€“ such as demographics or behaviours, so you can market to those customers more effectively.

In addition, if data about the customers is available, the data science team can help performing a customer segmentation.

Problem Statement and Goals
The competitive in financial industries are getting harder in the next decade. One of this industry main source of revenue are Interest Income which they could get by giving loan or credit payment facilities to customer. Therefore, the more the credit are given, the more interest they get.

Since the data are collected by every credit activities, the company hope they could get some insight by processing the data. This time, we have a data contains summary of the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. We will process this data using unsupervised learning methodology to segmentize the customer by finding a certain pattern in hope we could find some characteristic between each customer segment.

Then we will analyze each segment and plan the marketing approach that work best with each segment. We also give some recommendation for the next if we want to update the model or strategies.

Analytical Approach
We will do explanatory data analysis and finding some insight from the data. Then we will cluster the data using unsupervised learning with K-Means. After the data is segmented, we will decide the marketing approach for each segment.

Clustering Method
We will decide the numbers of cluster by using Elbow Method and Silhouette Method. Where in Elbow Method, the number of clusters are decided when the addition of one cluster does not provide significant change in the level of similarity, while in silhouette method, the number of cluster is decided by how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters.
